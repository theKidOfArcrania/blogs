# Github is Acquired by Microsoft!

Just recently, Microsoft acquired Github. This is very big news, something that
I have not been keeping track of, until one day, I saw a banner in Github
stating that. Immediately that to me as a great shock largely because of the
fact that in the past, "open source" and "Microsoft" do not mix together.
Actually, as a correction, Github itself is not open sourced, but it does host a
lot of open source projects.

Nevertheless, over the years, Github has become a de-facto hub for hosting any
open source projects. Furthermore, this is often a platform used by recruiters
to look at in addition to/ as a replacement of a traditional résumé. The fact
that Microsoft has now acquired all this also implies that Microsoft now has a
lot of power in determining the future of these endeavors.

## Disclaimer
Over the past few years, I have been slowly moving away from Microsoft products
(Windows, Microsoft Office, etc...) to using Linux. Now I am almost exclusively
running Ubuntu on my laptop, mainly because I am working mostly with Linux
ELF binaries/ C in an 'nix environment now. As such, some of my commentaries on
this issue is heavily biased. As such, this blog is only my opinions about this
topic, and should not be used as a factual article about the overall issue.

## Once a Hater... Always a Hater...?
Now I understand that Microsoft itself has gone through many internal changes,
for example, the current CEO is now Satya Nadella not Steve Balmer (who was the
CEO who made some [pretty bad comments about Linux][1]), but there still is that
tone there that Microsoft has against other possible competitors just because of
the ongoing monopolistic nature of Microsoft. 

Microsoft has also made comments suggesting that [they now love linux][2], but
this also has to be taken with a grain of salt. Logically, if they continue
their public campaign of "hating Linux", they will lose PR and will be at risk
of losing possible market share, which would nullify the original aim to take
out Linux as a possible competition. 

## If you can't beat them, join them.
If Microsoft were to try to get rid of any competition within Linux, now
Microsoft would try to embrace Linux full-heartedly, and then at the last 
minute, when they garner a critical mass of influence, they undermine Linux and
the open source community from the inside. 

This is always the danger of a possible monopoly: they slowly usurp power and
influence, and then once they have enough said influence, they implement [vendor
lock-ins][3] or any other type of restrictions, which will effectively crush 
remaining resistance against them. 

## A changed Microsoft?
Let me highlight what Microsoft has been doing recently: (a) Microsoft [joins
the Linux Foundation as a platinum member][4]. This means that they get a
representative at the board of directors, which gives them a good amount of
power within the Linux community, i.e. perhaps being able to provide talks at
prominent open source conferences, and some influence over the Linux kernel. (b)
Microsoft creates the [Windows Subsystem for Linux][5] (WSL), which if you are
not familiar with it, is a way to be able to run Linux and full-fledged Linux
programs (not ported or emulated) on top of Windows, without a virtualization
layer, such as VMware, or VirtualBox. One of the effects that come out of this
is that this will likely draw back some users to use Windows rather than Linux
because of the fact that many build tools and applications are easier to use 
in Linux. Furthermore, (c) Microsoft has also opened many of their projects,
such as [Visual Studio Code][6], [Typescript][7], and [.NET][8]. They are now
the organization with the [most contributors][9] on Github. Let me remind you,
though, a large portion of their code is still not open sourced. Namely, their
Visual Studio IDE and Windows OS are still closed source. These two alone
probably carry millions of lines of code, so I would probably say that for the
most part, Microsoft is closed sourced, not yet totally embracing the concept of
open source (then again, Github is mostly closed source as well.)

Honestly, I do not know what Microsoft is really up to with this apparent
paradigm shift, but I am still pretty skeptical if Microsoft has really changed
their views on Linux and open source, or whether if Microsoft will still resort
to its old "embrace, extend, extinguish" motto. In fact, I think on the
contrary, what Microsoft is doing now in the Open source and Linux community, is
doing just that. The question is, will Micrsoft "extinguish" Linux or lessen its
influence overall? It's hard to say, but I have a feeling that many people will
voice out against Microsoft evenmore than they are right now if that does
happen (unless Microsoft does it really sneakily). 

## Microsoft's Github
So now the question lies, what will Microsoft do with Github? No doubtly,
Microsoft will try to use Github to increase their influence over others. I
think now, I will probably wait and see with what Microsoft will do with Github
(will they try ruining the service or not?), but I will always keep tabs opened
on this, and at the sign of a downturn, I will probably fully migrate to Gitlab.
Bye bye, Github, hello Gitlab?
